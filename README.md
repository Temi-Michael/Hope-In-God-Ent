Hello World,

My name is Temi Michael, I also call myself Lazy Coder.
This website was created for my mum to help foster her business, it's not complete as I would want to add a payment system to the backend code and as well the email notification when an order has been placed or when a placed order has been paid for as well as the number or quantity available for customers to order from.
Yes, it is quite a lot but not a lot at the same time.
But it seems like there is a lot of work to be done as well.

Happy Coding.
